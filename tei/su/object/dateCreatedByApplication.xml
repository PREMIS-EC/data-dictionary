        <p>Use the most precise date available. This is the date the object was
            created by the creating application, not the date any copy was made
            externally or by the repository. For example, if a file is created by
            Microsoft Word in 2001 and two copies are made in 2003, the
            <bold>dateCreatedByApplication</bold> of all three files is 2001. The
            date a file is written to storage can be recorded as an Event.If the
            object itself contains internal creation and modification dates, the
            modification date should be used as <bold>dateCreatedByApplication</bold>.
            The creation date, in PREMIS terms, of an Object is the time that it was
            last modified; that is, the last time the document was saved. This is
            discussed in the 1:1 Principle INSERTLINKHERE section. If the
            application is a Web harvester capturing an object at a point intime,
            use the date captured as the creation date.</p>

        <p>To aid machine processing, value should use a structured form. To
            facilitate exchange of PREMIS-conformant metadata, use of standard
            conventions, for instance as used in the date elements in the PREMIS
            schema, is recommended.</p>
