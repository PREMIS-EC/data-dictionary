        <!-- PREMIS Rationale -->
        <p>Each object held in the preservation repository must have a unique
            identifier to allow other entities to refer to it and to relate it to
            descriptive, technical, and other metadata unambiguously.</p>

    <div type="creationmaintenance">
        <!-- PREMIS Creation / Maintenance -->
        <p>An identifier may be created by the repository system at the time of
            ingest, or it may be created or assigned outside of the repository and
            submitted with an object as metadata. Similarly, identifiers can be
            generated automatically or manually.</p>

        <!-- PREMIS Usage notes -->
        <p>The <bold>objectIdentifier</bold> is mandatory for all Objects stored. The
            <bold>objectIdentifier</bold> is repeatable in order to allow both
            repository-assigned and externally-assigned identifiers to be recorded.
            See “Creation/Maintenance” note above. Primary identifiers must be
            unique within the repository. They may be preexisting, and in use in
            other digital object management systems. Ideally, secondary identifiers
            should also be unique but sometimes this is not possible (e.g., if the
            values are inherited from a legacy system which did not enforce this or
            only identified items at a higher level). Identifiers for each item must
            be sufficient to identify the item uniquely at the appropriate level of
            aggregation. For example, an Intellectual Entity that represents all
            books in the same edition could use an ISBN but this would be
            insufficient to identify a particular copy of that book. A preservation
            repository needs to know both the type of object identifier and the
            value. If the value itself contains the identifier type (e.g.,
            “oai:lib.uchicago.edu:1”), the identifier type does not need to be
            recorded explicitly. Similarly, if the repository uses only one type of
            identifier, the type can be assumed and does not need to be recorded. A
            persistent identifier should be used, but the particular identifier
            scheme is an implementation-specific decision.</p>
