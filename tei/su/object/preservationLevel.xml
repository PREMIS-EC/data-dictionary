        <!-- PREMIS Definition -->
        <p>Information indicating the decision or policy on the set of preservation
            functions to be applied to an object and the context in which the
            decision or policy was made.</p>

        <!-- PREMIS Rationale -->
        <p>Some preservation repositories will offer multiple preservation options
            depending on factors such as the value or uniqueness of the material,
            the “preservability” of the format, the amount the customer is willing
            to pay, etc. In such circumstances the <gi>preservationLevelValue</gi>
            that applies may need to be directly associated with an Object. The
            choice of a particular preservation option for an object may also
            require further explanation. This can depend on the preservation
            functions expected to be applied to the object (which can be described
            by assigning a <bold>preservationLevelType</bold>) and/or the context in
            which a set of preservation options is applicable (which can be
            described by assigning a <gi>preservationLevelRole</gi>). The
            distinction between <bold>preservationLevelType</bold> and
            <gi>preservationLevelRole</gi> can be illustrated by examples. One
            possible preservation level type is “Bit preservation level”. This might
            have values of ‘Low’, ‘Medium’ or ‘High’, where, for example, in 2015
            technology examples for:</p>
        <p>
            <list type="bulleted">
                <label>1</label>
                <item>‘Low’ means ordinary on-site backup</item>
                <label>2</label>
                <item>‘Medium’ means two copies on different media types with a
                    minimum of 150 km distance between the stored copies, with
                    separate checksums that are integrity checked annually</item>
                <label>3</label>
                <item>‘High’ means solutions a minimum of 5 independent copies on a
                    variety of storage media distributed over different
                    organizations in several continents with quarterly integrity
                    checks.</item>
            </list>
        </p>
        <p>The <bold>preservationLevelRole</bold> can then be used to distinguish, for
            example, if this level is an aim or has actually been achieved. It is
            also possible to assign the rationale for choosing the value (which can
            be described by adding a <bold>preservationLevelRationale</bold>).</p>

        <!-- PREMIS Usage notes -->
        <p>If the repository offers only a single preservation level or the
            preservation level can be calculated externally (e.g., based on the
            information in a technical registry or by the type of collection), this
            value does not need to be explicitly recorded with Objects within the
            repository. Application of a particular set of
            <bold>preservationLevel</bold> semantic units may only cover a single
            Representation of an object: Representations in other technical forms or
            serving other functions may have a different <gi>preservationLevel</gi>
            applied. The container may be repeated if a preservation level value
            needs to be recorded in additional contexts (see
            <bold>preservationLevelRole</bold>,or part of a context (see
            <bold>preservationLevelType</bold>).</p>
