        <!-- PREMIS Rationale -->
        <p>Repositories may assign <bold>preservationLevelValues</bold> in different
            contexts which must be differentiated, and may need to record more than
            one context. This allows a distinction, for example, between the
            intended preservation level and the current achievable preservation
            level. Note: This is distinct from the <bold>preservationLevelType</bold>
            which distinguishes the purpose of the <bold>preservationLevel</bold>.</p>

        <!-- PREMIS Usage notes -->
        <p>This optional semantic unit qualifies the sense or context in which the
            <bold>preservationLevelValue</bold> in the current preservationLevel
            container is applied. For example, a repository may have a legislated
            obligation to “fully preserve” object X (which is of format F) but is
            presently only capable of preserving objects of format F at a
            “bit-level”. The repository may need to record both the required or
            intended level of preservation (e.g.
            <bold>preservationLevelRole</bold>=“requirement”) and the current capability
            (e.g. <bold>preservationLevelRole</bold>=“capability”). In transferring
            custody of material from one repository to another, it may also be
            important for the receiving repository to know the sense in which
            <bold>preservationLevelValue</bold> should be understood. A receiving
            repository may not need to know a “capability” preservation level of
            which the transferring repository was capable (as this will have little
            bearing on its own capabilities), but it needs to know any preservation
            level “requirements” for material for which it is now taking
            responsibility. It is good practice to specify
            <bold>preservationLevelRole</bold> for clarity even if the repository
            only assigns <bold>preservationLevelValue</bold> in one sense or context. If
            more than one <bold>preservationLevel</bold> is recorded with the same
            <bold>preservationLevelType</bold>, <bold>preservationLevelRole</bold>
            should always be supplied. If more than one sense or context needs to be
            expressed for the same object, (e.g. both the “requirement” and
            “capability” are recorded), separate <bold>preservationLevel</bold>
            containers should be used.</p>
